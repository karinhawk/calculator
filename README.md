# calculator

A javascript calculator styled by HTML and SCSS (BEM standards).
The deployed website will host the calculator.
The calculator can process simple calculations with two inputs. Due to using parseFloat these inputs also calculate if they're decimals.
The calculator has a function AC button which can clear the screen and all previously entered information.
When an answer is displayed, a new calculation can be entered immediately afterwards without pressing AC.
The percentage button allows for a percentage to be converted to a decimal.
Could round to 2dp but decided against as most calculators don't round.
The design is mobile-first but due to responsive design can also work on larger screens.
Lighthouse report of Accessibility for both mobile and desktop is 100.
